# EC4305-Project - Statistical Modelling and Copula Analysis

This repository contains the code, data, and analysis for our EC4305 Applied Econometrics project.
The project investigates inflation-adjusted HDB resale prices and floor area, focusing on:
- Marginal distribution modelling (parametric + non-parametric)
- Copula-based dependence modelling
- Regression analysis for price determinants
The work is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebooks, supported by custom scripts for copula construction and diagnostics.
