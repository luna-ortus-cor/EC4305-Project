# EC4305-Project - Statistical Modelling and Copula Analysis

This repository contains the code, data, and analysis for our EC4305 Applied Econometrics project.
The project investigates inflation-adjusted HDB resale prices and floor area, focusing on:
- Marginal distribution modelling (parametric + non-parametric)
- Copula-based dependence modelling
- Regression analysis for price determinants

The work is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebooks. 

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from the public GitHub repository:
https://github.com/concealexi/resalerangers

We use their cleaned and structured HDB resale transaction data as the foundation for our marginal distribution modelling, copula dependence analysis, and regression modelling.
